  abstract        = {The present work is devoted to the analysis and investigation of traffic in software defined networks (SDN). This article describes the main provisions of the SDN concept, the task of investigating traffic is presented, and a possible way to solve it is considered. The task of traffic research includes an analysis of the basic characteristics and traffic indicators of SDN. As a possible solution, a method of full-scale modeling is proposed. In this paper, a full-scale experiment was performed on a real network for the modeling and analysis of SDN traffic. Also in the work, the obtained result is approximated to understand to which theoretical distribution law the empirical distribution obtained in the experiment described in this article is closer. In addition, in this scientific paper, self-similarity of SDN traffic simulated to the experiment input is estimated.},

In the article the authors briefly describe these formalisms with an emphasis on their practical application.},

We comprehensively explain the in-depth features that enable the functionalities of Mininet to describe its underlying mechanisms for lightweight network simulation. We conclude with an example showcasing the different features discussed throughout this chapter.},

We consider SEIJR models involving populations of susceptible, exposed, infective, diagnosed, dead, and recovered individuals, and infer from data all the parameter models, in particular, the transmission and recovery rates. We exemplify the procedure using Covid-19 data from Spain since the onset of the current pandemic. Successive nonpharmaceutical actions such as lockdowns, distancing, and release of mobility restrictions, define stages in the data which are reflected in the parameter values. Tracking the evolution of the different populations with time, we can infer the evolution of the total fraction of subjects affected by the virus, including asymptomatic individuals. Using the resulting models as constraints in optimization problems for adequate costs we can gain insight on the parameter regimes in which the epidemic would remain controlled, even when migration effects are included.},

Recently, it was proven that the explicit solution of the model requires the introduction of a new transcendental special function, related to the Wright's Omega function and Lambert W function. Asymptotic methods and iterative numerical routines suitable for parametric estimation of the SIR model are discussed as well. The methods are exemplified with influenza and COVID-19 datasets.},

Using Kathar{\'a}, a lightweight network emulator, is a scalable and cost-effective solution. Integrating Kathar{\'a} into the Computer Networking through a set of proper exercises with different objectives can significantly enhance the teaching and learning performance. Such a kind of work must tackle three main challenges: the diversity of protocols, simplicity of the exercises, and scalability of the networks. Our solution leverages the features of Kathar{\'a} to make hands-on lab exercises more accessible, reproducible, and customizable for the students instead of asking for a strong background in network programming. Our observation during the teaching process concludes that this hands-on lab facilitates the learning of students from different schools, such as information technology, education, and engineering.},

Because of the high cost of physical hardware, these tests are always performed in a virtual environment. Kathará is a network emulation system which accurately reproduces the behaviour of a real system. It can exploit several virtualization technologies leveraging on its modularity. Lately, Kathará has been rewritten to overcome some implementation limitations and performance issues. This paper presents the Kathará model and its new architecture, demonstrating its value, comparing its scalability and performance with Netkit (another state-of-the-art tool for network emulation) and with the previous version of Kathará.},
